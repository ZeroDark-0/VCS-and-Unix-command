Absolute vs Relative Paths
Absolute: Starts from root / → /home/user/documents/file.txt
Relative: Relative to current directory → documents/file.txt or ../sibling/file.txt
Directories and Hidden Files
Hidden files/directories start with . (e.g., .git, .bashrc). View with ls -a.
Inode Concept
Every file/directory has an inode (index node) storing metadata (permissions, size, location). File names are just pointers to inodes.

```bash
pwd                          # /home/user
ls -l                        # list with details
ls -a                        # show hidden files
ls -i                        # show inode numbers
```
